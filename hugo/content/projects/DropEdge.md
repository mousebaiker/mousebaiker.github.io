abstract: We explore several techniques, such as truncated SVD and weight orthogonalization, that allow the construction of deep graph convolutional networks and preserve the ability of network to train effectively. We conduct experiments with modified DropEdge <a href="#ref_8" id="cite_8">[8]</a> architecture on several public datasets to access the quality improvements.
