abstract: The thesis investigates an application of generative adversarial networks to generate natural looking images from synthetic ones to enlarge training dataset for traffic sign classifier. <br> Complete system, based on CycleGAN <a href="#ref_6" id="cite_6">[6]</a>, allows to get 7% improvement in classes with no prior real data without sacrifice in total accuracy. </p>
